## Overview

The **State Single Page Application (SPA)** project demonstrates how to implement a state-based navigation system using the `history.pushState()` API and event listeners in JavaScript. This simple yet effective application allows users to switch between different states like "home", "search", "likes", and "profile" while maintaining smooth navigation within a single page. It's a great example for developers learning how to handle state in web applications without the need for page reloads.

The main goal of this project is to provide a clean, efficient implementation of a state-driven, dynamic navigation system, making it ideal for use in applications that require client-side routing.

## Features

- **State Management**: Uses the `history.pushState()` API to manage state changes and browser history without reloading the page.
- **Simple Navigation**: Switches between different sections (Home, Search, Likes, Profile) by clicking icons.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.
- **Clean UI**: Minimalistic design with color-coded sections for each state.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text

## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajjad-sisakhtpour/state-single-page-application.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd state-single-page-application
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
   - This will launch the project on your local machine.
   - No additional dependencies or build tools are needed for this basic example.

## Usage

1. Open the project in a modern browser.
2. You will see four navigation icons (`H`, `S`, `L`, `P`) representing the sections Home, Search, Likes, and Profile.
3. Clicking on any of the icons will change the content and background color based on the selected state.
4. The browser history is updated accordingly, and the back/forward buttons will work as expected.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the project works:

- **Home State**: Clicking the "H" icon will change the background color to red and display the "home" title.
- **Search State**: Clicking the "S" icon will change the background color to blue and display the "search" title.
- **Likes State**: Clicking the "L" icon will change the background color to green and display the "likes" title.
- **Profile State**: Clicking the "P" icon will change the background color to pink and display the "profile" title.
